// for optimization, gg and xx is rate to compare isbuy or not, if dd smaller than xx, wont sell to catch the trend, vice versa.
// button 0 is selling all, button 1 is buying
// dd for drawdown
Inputs:
gg(1.3),
xx(0.4),
dayno(50);

vars:mp(0),button(0),dd(0);
dd = highest(high,dayno)/close-1;
mp = marketposition;

// harder condition to reduce commission fee and catch some noise
// 100days average
if c > average(high,35) and c[1]<average(high,35) then button = 1;
if c > average(high,35) and c[1]<average(high,35) then value2 = close;

if c < average(low,35) and c[1] > average(low,35) or dd > xx then button = 0;

if button = 1 and close > value2 * gg then begin
	if dd > 0.1 and dd[1] <= 0.1 then buy 1000/close shares next bar at market;
	
end;

if button = 0 then sell all shares next bar at market;
